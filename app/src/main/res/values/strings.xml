        <item>Step into a neighborhood bakery from Argentina to Peru, and you\'re likely to find these tender,
            filled cookies piled high behind the counter. The crumbly bite of shortbread gives way to a sweet
            layer of dulce de leche, a caramel-like candy made by gently cooking sweetened milk until it turns
            into a rich, mellow treat.</item>
        <item>For a floury lesson in gluten\'s architectural wonders, whip up a batch of traditional strudel dough.
            The real thing is stretched not rolled into an improbably thin sheet; according to legend, it should be
            transparent enough to read a newspaper through.</item>
        <item>Dozens of delicate layers melt into a single tender bite in this syrupy confection, which is among the
            sweetest legacies of the Ottoman Empire. While it remains a sought-after treat through the Levant, Balkans,
            the Caucasus and North Africa regions that were once ruled from Constantinople the spiritual home of baklava
            is surely the modern-day country of Turkey. </item>
        <item>Along with fairy tales and mountain-top castles, Germany\'s Black Forest region is known as the namesake if
            not the origin of the country\'s most luscious cake. Dark rounds of chocolate cake are doused in a cherry
            syrup spiked with kirschwasser, a sour cherry brandy, then stacked atop a thin, chocolate base with deep
            layers of whipped cream and fresh cherries. </item>
        <item>Threads of crisp, golden knafeh dough wrap around a rich nut filling in this sweet dessert, which is an
            elegant and aromatic relative of baklava. Unlike baklava, borma is often fried, adding an extra infusion of
            flavor and a crisp texture that stands up to a sugary bath in flavored syrup. </item>
        <item>Fudgy or cakey? Corner piece or slice from the middle? Aficionados of this beloved American sweet are sure
            to have a take on the best and worst way to make a brownie. One of the earliest recipes appeared in Fannie Farmer\'s
            1906 "Boston Cooking School Cook Book," using the unsweetened chocolate that lends brownies a fudgy texture.</item>
        <item>A shattering-crisp shell gives way to a creamy cheese filling in this Sicilian classic, whose roots reach deep into
            the island\'s diverse culinary history. With origins at the wild Carnival celebrations at Palermo, the traditional
            cannolo is filled with silky-smooth ricotta cheese made from sheep\'s milk. </item>
        <item>October 4 might be Cinnamon Bun Day on the Swedish calendar, but many bun aficionados insist that the aromatic
            cardamom version outshines cinnamon\'s more assertive charms. One of a family of vetebullar, or wheat buns, cardamom
            buns are best enjoyed as a part of fika, the coffee break that comes twice daily in many Swedish workplaces.</item>
        <item>The quintessential American treat is deceptively simple: a basic, creamed-butter cookie recipe turns out to have
            endless subtle variations that produc dramatically different results. Whatever your favorite version, a perfect chocolate
            chip cookie is a delicate balance of textures and flavors. A crispy rim gives way to a tender, melting center, and
            the buttery sweetness of the dough sets off the slight edge of bittersweet chocolate and brown sugar.
        </item>
        <item>An airy confection made with just a handful of ingredients, chocolate mousse is a delicious paradox: the richer
            it is, the lighter it seems. Gallic chefs have been whipping up chocolate mousse the word means "foam" in French
            for at least a few hundred years, but the quest for foamy chocolate is much older.</item>
        <item>Bouncy, buttery rounds of vanilla cake are piled high with shredded coconut and seven-minute frosting for a classic
            Southern dessert. This is the kind of all-American sweet that stars at potlucks, cake walks and church picnics, and it\'s
            often made with recipes passed down on hand-written recipe cards.</item>
        <item>Even in a crowded field of tempting Moroccan sweets, these filled pastries are perennial favorites, and the
            labor-intensive dessert appears at celebrations and special meals throughout the year. </item>
        <item>Shiny, burnt sugar tops this creamy dessert, and the perfect crème brûlée is a study in contrasts. Each bite
            should blend a bit of crispy caramel burned just to the very edge of bitterness with the aromatic flavor of vanilla custard. </item>
        <item>Follow the wafting scent of egg custard into a Hong Kong bakery to sample one of the territory\'s most iconic
            treats. Perfectly sized for eating out-of-hand, dan tats are best enjoyed fresh from the oven, when the warm
            custard meets a perfectly crisp crust. And with a map-spanning backstory, dan tats are among the tastiest symbols of globalization. </item>
        <item>Golden pastry tops sweet cream, nuts or salty cheese in this syrupy dessert, which offers a satisfying contrast
            of texture and flavor. Like many Middle Eastern desserts, knafeh is soaked in an aromatic sugar syrup that infuses
            the pastry topping and filling with the flavor of roses or orange blossoms.</item>
